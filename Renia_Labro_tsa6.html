            <h2>Kaede Rukawa</h2>
            <p>Rukawa is likely based on NBA legend Michael Jordan, as he is considered at the end as the strongest player in Japanese High School basketball. They both have the same black armband, style of play and an incredible sense of 1 on 1 that allows them to defeat any opponent.</p>

            <h2>Takenori Akagi</h2>
            <p>Inoue drew clear influences from the NBA at the time. Sakuragi's delinquent behavior and obsession with becoming “The Rebound King” appears to be inspired by Dennis Rodman. Sakuragi's teammate and captain of the Shohoku basketball team, Takenori Akagi, is a physical center reminiscent of Patrick Ewing.</p>
